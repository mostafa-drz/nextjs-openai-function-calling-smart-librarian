# Smart Librarian App

The Smart Librarian App is a simple demo showcasing [OpenAIâ€™s function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) capabilities and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It demonstrates how to build an AI-powered application that suggests books based on user interests by combining database queries with AI-generated responses.

This project is designed to help developers understand how OpenAI functions can be integrated into real-world applications.
